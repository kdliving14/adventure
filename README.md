# A Choose Your Own Adventure Web Application

Nostalgic for the times of choose your own adventure books but not satisfied with the PG storylines, I created a this: *Adventure*. 

Hopefully I can get some writers to help add more stories, but there is one story already preloaded.

## User Story
- User can create a profile & login
- User can select a story
- User can choose where the story goes
- User can see all choices made in the story so far
- User can reset your progress in the story

## Stretch Goals

- User profile edit function
- Sound system (backround music and sounds)
- Images in all events and choices in current story
- More stories (of varying genres)
- Input stories from application instead of only backend
- Inventory System
- TBD
